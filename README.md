# portfolio-project
now this is for my portfolio project, don't know what i am doing but lets go.
at first i did not undestand how i should go about this, but i believe that with commitment and focus i can actually do this, what was making things even more difficult was that i missed the first few weeks of my MVP now i had nno idea of what i was missing out, and that i had failed the first task or project automatically made things even more difficult,but one thin i can bet is that i can do this with certainty because ia m the one who needs this .
now for the promise that i had to myself.
now for the progress this is  aa bit difficult but iam proud of self for comming this far and everything i have done so far was my own work nobody elses
